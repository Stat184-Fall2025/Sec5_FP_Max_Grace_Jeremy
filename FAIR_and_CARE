## CARE

One challenge we had with determining whether or not this data conformed to the CARE principles was assessing whether or not the datasets ignored power differentials and historical contexts related to Indigenous Peoples.

collective benefit: This data includes all countries and supports use and reuse by Indigenous nations.
It enriches potential governance and engagement of citizens as it provides all nations and communities with a clear view of each country's attributes.
The data benefits all communities in an equitable manner.

authority to control: The data is available and accessible to Indigenous Peoples.
This way, the datasets support Indigenous governance.

responsibility: When using this data, we ensured that any representation of data from Indigenous nations were respectful of the dignity of all Indigenous nations and communities.

ethics: The datasets provide an accurate and fair view of all countries represented.
This minimizes harm and maximizes benefit as it does not stigmatize Indigenous communities and represents all communities fairly.
