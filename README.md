# Project Title

This repo was created for our final project in Stat 184. It will contain all of the neccesary files and information required for the project.

## Overview

Our goal is to take the CountryData and CountryCentroids datasets, wrangle and tidy them into usable data, and create meaningful visualizations. The CountryData dataset contains 76 columns of data covering over 250 countries, and we plan to show some interesting findings that we have come across.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

An interesting thing that we have discovered is that there is an almost completely global lull in birth rate. When observing birth rate in comparison to the population of a country, we still see lower birth rates despite whatever the country's population may be. The only areas with higher birth rates are in most of Africa, and a small portion in the Middle East. This can be seen in the BirthRateVsPopulation image inside of this repository.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

We are using two datasets found in the R "dcData" library. They are the "CountryData" and "CountryCentroids" datasets.

## Current Plan
Our current plan for this project is to load all necessary libraries and datasets, wrangle data to create cases that fit the information we are focusing on, create visualizations from the tidied data, write data stories that explain relationships between our data, use GitHub to collaborate as a group, submit project as a polished QMD file.
