# Project Title

This repo was created for our final project in Stat 184. It will contain all of the neccesary files and information required for the project.

## Overview

Our goal is to take the CountryData and CountryCentroids datasets, wrangle and tidy them into usable data, and create meaningful visualizations. The CountryData dataset contains 76 columns of data covering over 250 countries, and we plan to show some interesting findings that we have come across.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

We are using two datasets found in the R "dcData" library. They are the "CountryData" and "CountryCentroids" datasets.
